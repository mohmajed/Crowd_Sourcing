            <p>‘25/10 Crowd Sourcing’ is a workshop structure that allows you to rapidly generate and sift through a group’s
                important actionable ideas in less than 30 minutes. We’ve applied this structure both to small (12–20 members)
                and large groups (>150). Not only it is an innovative way to identify important, ‘out of the box’-solutions, it is
                also appreciated by participants for its highly active nature.
